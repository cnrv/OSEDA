# Call for Papers for the 1st OSEDA Workshop

# The OSEDA community and workshop

We believe that in the future, every chip designer can design, verify, and produce chips using open source instruction set (RISC-V) through open source EDA, just like using open source GNU toolchain to compile source codes written in ANSI C.


To achieve this shared vision, active contributors from the RISC-V open source community and the EDA research field initiated the OSEDA community.

The OSDEA community is committed to promoting the use of open source EDA in the RISC-V community, to promoting communication between open source EDA developers and RISC-V chip designers, to promoting the development and growth of the open source EDA technical community, especially the technical community in China.

The short-term goal of the OSEDA community is to attract more than a thousand developers by 2025, and more than 10,000 developers to the open source EDA community to contribute code to open source projects by 2035.

In order to promote the communication and interaction of open source EDA developers and users in China and Worldwide, the OSEDA community plans to hold the first open source EDA workshop (aka OSEDA Workshop) on the afternoon of August 28, 2022 (Sunday). This seminar will be held at the Zhangjiang Campus of ShanghaiTech University as a co-event of the 2nd RISC-V China Summit.
